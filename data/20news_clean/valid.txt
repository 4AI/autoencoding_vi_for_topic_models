well folks , mac plus finally gave ghost weekend starting life 512k way back 1985. sooo , 'm market new machine bit sooner intended ...

Yep , 's pretty much . I 'm Jew I understand Jewish way thinking . However , Jews believe Covenant YHWH Patriarchs ( Abraham Moses , case ) establishes Moral Code follow mankind . Even Jews could decide boundaries fall , though . As I understand , Sadducees believed Torah required , whereas Pharisees ( ancestors modern Judaism ) believed Torah available interpretation lead understanding required Morality nuances ( - > Talmud ) . The essence Biblical Morality interface Man YHWH ( Jew Christian ) necessarily indicate anything YHWH outside relationship ( although one speculate ) . The trouble n't really know `` created His image '' means . I 've heard number different opinions still come conclusion . This rather upsets Apple Cart one wants base Life Script shaky foundation ( mix metaphors unashamedly ! ) As living Christ 's example , know little Jesus person . We recorded utterances set narratives followers , small references comtemporary historians . Revelation aside , one `` know '' Christ second-hand worse . This attempt debunk Christianity ( although may seem way initially ) , point I`m trying make really Bible interpret , interpretation humanity . I guess Faith Relevation comes inherent subjectiveness . No . There may absolute moral code . There undoubtably multiple moral codes . The multiple moral codes may founded absolute moral code . As example , parent may tell child never swear , child may assume parent never swears simply parent told child `` wrong '' . Now , parent may swear like trooper pub bar ( children ) . The `` wrongness '' child disobeys parent . The parent may feel `` inappropriate '' swear front children may quite happy swear front animals . The analogy quite hold water child knows type parent ( may parent later life ) get gist ? Incidentally , young child considers directive absolute gets older ( see Piaget ) learns morality .

{ Description `` External Tank '' option SSF redesign deleted } Yo Ken , let 's keep on-top things ! Both `` External Tank '' '' Wingless Orbiter '' options deleted SSF redesign options list . Today 's ( 4/23 ) edition New York Times reports O'Connor told panel redesign proposals dropped , using `` giant external fuel tanks used launching space shuttles , '' building `` station around existing space shuttle wings tail removed . '' Currently , three options considered , presented advisory panel meeting yesterday ( reported today 's Times ) . Option `` A '' - Low Cost Modular Approach This option studied team MSFC . { As aside , SSF redesign teams MSFC , JSC , LaRC supporting SRT ( Station Redesign Team ) Crystal City . Both LeRC Reston folks also on-site locations , helping respective teams redesign activities . } Key features option : - Uses `` Bus-1 '' , modular bus developed Lockheed that's qualified STS ELV 's . The bus provides propulsion , GN & C Communications , & Data Management . Lockheed developed Air Force . - A `` Power Station Capability '' obtained 3 Shuttle Flights . SSF Solar arrays used provide 20 kW power . The vehicle flies `` arrow mode '' optimize microgravity environment . Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize vehilce power source 30 day missions . - Human tended capability ( opposed old SSF sexist term man-tended capability ) achieved addition US Common module . This modified version existing SSF Lab module ( docking ports added International Partners ' labs , taking place nodes SSF ) . The Shuttle docked station 60 day missions . The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability . - International Human Tended . Add NASDA & ESA modules , add another 20 kW power - Permanent Human Presence Capability . Add 3rd power module , U.S. habitation module , ACRV ( Assured Crew Return Vehicle ) . Option `` B '' - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option `` B '' team based LaRC , lead Mike Griffin . This option looks alot like existing SSF design , come know love : ) This option assumes lightweight external tank available use SSF assembly flights ( option `` A '' ) . Also , number flights computed 51.6 inclination orbit , options `` A '' `` B '' . The build-up occurs six phases : - Initial Research Capability reached 3 flights . Power transferred vehicle Orbiter/Spacelab , visits . - Man-Tended Capability ( Griffin yet adopted non-sexist language ) achieved 8 flights . The U.S . Lab deployed , 1 solar power module provides 20 kW power . - Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs 10 flights , keeping one Orbiter on-orbit use ACRV ( sometimes would two Orbiters on-orbit - ACRV , second one comes Logistics & Re-supply ) . - A `` Two Fault Tolerance Capability '' achieved 14 flights , addition 2nd power module , another thermal control system radiator , propulsion modules . - After 20 flights , Internationals on-board . More power , Habitation module , ACRV added finish assembly 24 flights . Most systems currently SSF used as-is option , exception data management system , major changes .

Actually , fossil fuel plants run hotter usual boiling-water reactor nuclear plants . ( There 's gripe industry nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology ) . So it's important nuclear plants get cold end system cold possible . Hence big cooling towers . Oil gas fired steam plants also condensers , usually sized get steam back hot water , way ambient . Some plants cool condensers water , rather air ; one Canadian official , asked `` thermal pollution '' de-icing river , said , `` Up , view heat resource '' . Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers . The water used purified solids , otherwise crud boiler plumbing water boils . Purifying water boiler use bigger job cooling , boiler water recycled .

Yes . ( I adamantly environmentalist . I use styrofoam table service . Please keep mind read post - I wish attack environmentalism ) A half truth least dangerous complete lie .

When one error rejected , style push people opposite error . Therefore earth God 's intricate handiwork , rubbish , God . Mother earth one primarily love serve . I see two facets response : 1 : Care environment . Treat proper respect , God 's intricate handiwork health future generation , showing facet one disregardful things constitute Apostle Paul called `` becoming things men possible means I might save .

How define war ? Do seiges constant attacks villiages count acts war , Jews ? January , 1948 : Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold 1000 men attack Kfar Etzion , 14 miles south Jerusalem , cutting supply lines . Attacks Yehiam ( Western Galilee ) kibbutz Tirat Tzvi . By Mid-March , The Jewish settlements Negev cut land links rest Jewish population . The Etzion group villiages , near Hebron , cut , 42 members convoy trying supply Yehiam slaughtered , cutting villiage . Jerusalem seige , cut supply route Tel Aviv ( bombed supply trucks left side road day memoriam ) . By time , 1200 Jews killed . Of course , n't war , since 's Arabs attacking . Just like last week Fatah launched Katyusha rockets Northern israel . Where uprising end war begin ? Will still 'Intifadah ' PLO brings tanks ?

I agree assessment . Furthermore , promotion providing greater protection bare voice quite true , far goes . However , way fulfill stated goal letting LE wiretap `` terrorists drug dealers '' restrict stronger techniques . Wiretap targets presently use strong encryption , weak encryption , ( vast majority ) encryption . The latter two classes tapped . With weak encryption every phone , no-encryption class merged weak-encryption class . Will introduction Clipper cause targets presently enjoying strong privacy give ? , rely privacy system expressly designed deny people like ? I doubt . The mere introduction scheme give government *nothing* . The stated goal preventing degradation wiretapping capabilities fulfilled restriction domestic cryptography , restriction . `` Clipper '' appears sop , given public mute complaints . We would find grossly inadequate tradeoff , I fear public large care . I hate even mention gun control , people seem think `assault weapon ' ( NYT uses word ) sort automatic weapon , .50 caliber maybe . Who wants thing legal ? Well , people know even less cryptology ; I suspect strong cryptography could easily labeled `` much secrecy law-abiding citizens need '' . What say opinion , matters , continue unless overturned . And courts reluctant annul law regulation , going length decide cases grounds . Furthermore , Congress get away quite bit . They could levy burdensome tax ; would place enforcement hands BATF , 've seen really n't want case . They could invoke Commerce Clause ; seems likely . This clause get anywhere days . The 18th required Supreme Court ruled prohibitory statute unconstitutional . In 1970 Congress prohibited many drugs , textual nod Commerce Clause . The Controlled Substances Act 1970 still stands . I think government could get away .

Ted , 're missing vital point . As Roger Lustig pointed previous response , reason Schott banned baseball known call think racially biased manner constant basis .

He n't hire anyone Schott . Dave Pallone , former NL umpire admitted homosexual , decided assist protest Mets game Shea . He , like , thinks Bonilla suspended baseball .

For second straight game , California scored ton late runs crush Brewhas . It six runs 8th 12-5 win Monday five 8th six 9th 12-2 win yesterday . Jamie Navarro pitched seven strong innings , Orosco , Austin , Manzanillo Lloyd took part mockery bullpen yesterday . How 's numbers ? Maldanado pitched three scoreless innings Navarro 's ERA 0.75 . The next lowest staff Wegman 5.14 . Ouch ! It n't look much better hitters . Hamilton batting .481 , Thon hitting .458 seven RBI . The next highest three . The next best hitter Jaha .267 Vaughn , team 's HR , .238 . Another ouch . Looking stats , 's hard see team 2-5 . In fact , 2-5 n't sound bad 're averaging three runs/game giving 6.6/game . Still , 's early things undoubtedly get better . The offense come around , bullpen major worry . Fetters , Plesac Austin gave Brewers great middle relief last year . Lloyd , Maldanado , Manzanillo , Fetters , Austin Orosco pick pace team successful . Milwaukee won number games last year middle relief either held small leads kept small deficits place . The starters okay , defense alright hitting come around , bullpen big question mark . In news , Nilsson Doran reactivated yesterday , William Suero sent Tim McIntosh picked Montreal . Today 's game California cancelled .
: In case , I think Viola would made better signing . Why ? : Viola younger , left handed ( many left handed starters : Toronto ? Well , I agree Viola better signing . However , everyone say want lefthanded starters ? I understand lefthanded spot relievers , even though usually face righthanded batters lefthanded batters . I n't understand people insist lefthanded starters , unless park effect ( e.g. , Yankee Stadium ) . Most batters MLB righthanded , righthanded starters platoon advantage often lefthanded starters . I guess one argument lefty starters certain teams may vulnerable LHP 's RHP 's . However , probably factor postseason , teams seldom juggle starters reason regular season . I think want best starters get , regardless whether lefties righties . Lefthanded starters tend higher ERA 's righthanded starters , precisely managers go way start inferior lefties ( perhaps platoon advantage ) . Am I missing something ?
Of course , want check honesty dealler , take knowing 's wrong , ask tell . : ) Of course 'll probably know right way , charge $ 20 service fee . : )

The long short story 75,000 people killed people tripping peacefull solutions lying ( could n't swing sacred cow without slammin nice , peaceful solution . ) 'Course Joshua jawbone ass spring mind ... I agree Bobby far : religion used kill large numbers people usually used form manner originally intended . That n't reduce number deaths directly caused religion , minor observation fact almost nothing pure Universe . The act honestly attempting find true meaning religious teaching many times inspired hatred led war . Many people led religious leaders involved stomache-contentsthan absolute truth , therefore driven kill leaders . The point many things involved religion often lead war . Whether things part religion , unpleasant side effect ( Bobby would ) result people switching Religion Atheism spontaneously , results . @ Religious groups long involved majority bloodiest parts Man 's history . @ Atheists , hand ( preen , preen ) typically ideological social caste , driven organize spread beliefs . The overuse Nazism Stalinism show true : Two groups clear specific ideologies using religious persecution means . Anyone see obvious - namely groups founded reasons *entirely* , used religious persecution belief system made powerfull - trying hard . Basically , Bobby uses examples wars *not* *specifically* fought religion many choices . Well , I 'm Key West flames heating bottom little silver butter-dishes . -ciao

I 've got fairly new car battery I take along 4x4 I go camping , sits around useless I 'm home . I wish I could get batteryless ups use , use heavy duty 5-volt regulator supply PC . But I guess 'd need -5v -12v ( +12 ) ( 2 batteries ? ) . An alternative would leave 40 AMP battery charger hooked battery run 12vdc 110vac converter running time , power goes , voi-la ! 110vac converter keeps running battery !

Yes , also understanding majority Islamic laws . However , I believe also certain legal rulings , five schools law ( 4 sunni 1 jaffari ) , levelled muslim non-muslims , within outside dar-al-islam . I know apostasy ( accompanied active , persistent , open hostility Islam ) falls category law . I know historically , apostasy rarely punished , let alone death penalty . My understanding Khomeini 's ruling based law apostasy ( alone ) . It well known Rushdie apostate long wrote offending novel certainly precedent Qur'an , hadith , Islamic history indiscriminantly levelling death penalties apostasy . I believe charge levelled Rushdie `` fasad '' . This ruling applies within outside domain Islamic state carried individuals . The reward offered Khomeini individuals within Iran . I would concur thrust fatwa ( I remember ) levelled author assisted publication book . However , charge `` fasad '' encompass number lesser charges . I remember diplomatic relations broke Britain Iran fatwa - Iran stressed condemnation author , removal book circulation two preliminary conditions resolving '' crisis '' . But correct point banning book main thrust behind fatwa . Islamic charges fasad levelled people , books . The Rushdie situation followed Iran several months issuance fatwa . Rushdie went media blitz , presenting lone knight guarding sacred values secular democracy mocking foolish concerns people crazy enough actually hold religious beliefs sacred . Fanning flames milking controversy boost image push book , everywhere media . Then Muslim demonstrators several countries killed protesting book . Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned , climbed back media horse attack Muslims defend sacred rights . It point fatwa `` fasad '' issued . The fatwa levelled person Rushdie - actions Rushdie feed situation contribute legitimization ruling . The book remains circulation independant author publishers . The fatwa person Rushdie encompasses actions well . The crime certainly crime progress ( many levels ) played ( played ) full view media .

I think may chasing wrong problem . I n't think function overloading -- I sort thing time BC++ without hitch . The big problems I encountered porting MFC BC++ fact MFC _depends_ couple invalid C++ assumptions . I never gotten _entire_ ctrltest app run BC++ , reason MS makes bad assumptions order static/global objects initialized ( i.e . objects getting accessed initialized ) . The problem owner-draw menu code somewhere -- comment section , pieces ctrltest work fine . Two major gotchas I found using MFC BC++ : - The CFile : :OpenFlags enum uses hard-coded numbers open mode , rather manifest constants defined fcntrl.h ( differ MSC BC ) . - All MFC collection classes depend another bad C++ assumption -- reference base object used place reference derived object ( true pointers , NOT references ) . I sure problems along lines , I encountered ( yet ) . I seen MFC 2.0 yet , I hope addressed . If , MS's hype portability vendor 's compilers .

Is figment imagination ? Here another one : Source : `` Mitteilungsblatt , Berlin , December 1939 , Nr . 2 5-6 '' Yet another historical fact : fact years deliberately forgotten , concealed , wiped memory - fact Armenian-Nazi collaboration . A magazine called Mitteilungsblatt der Deutsch-Armenischen Gesselschaft clearest definite proof collaboration . The magazine first published Berlin 1938 Nazi rule Germany continued publication end 1944 . Even name magazine , implies declaration Armenian-Nazi cooperation , attention-getting . This magazine , every issue proves collaboration , historically important documentary evidence . It heap writing admonition world opinion mankind . In Nazi Germany , Armenians considered Aryan race certain political , economic , social rights thus granted . They occupied positions public service partners Nazi practices .

As subjects says , Windows 3.1 keeps crashing ( givinh GPF ) late . It never stable package , seems crash every day . The worst part crash consistently : ie I ca n't reproduce crashes , always GPF 's application . Sometimes I recover simply closing application caused error , times , windows acts strange , I need re-boot . Some background : I Leading Edge 486sx25 Phoenix BIOS . When I first got 4Mg memory . It ran windows fine ( many GPF 's ) . Then , couple weekends ago , I installed Lotus 123 windows ( ATM ) , game card additional 4 1Mg SIMMS . The Leading edge machine kind strange , IDE controler built motherboard , CPU actually sparate board plugs motherboard SIMMS uses Macintosh SIMMS ! Apparently I told Leading Edge parity bit built mother board . The original 4Mg 80ns SIMMS 2 chip variety SAMSUNG , ones I installed 8 chip SIMMS . They recognized fine BIOS RAM check . The game card generic $ 20 gamecard . The reason I mention hardware like sometimes rebooting machine using reset button ctl-alt-del still leaves machine kind flaky , turning n't . I n't tried taking RAM game card , I said GPF reproducible . I gone entire day using computer problems I might get 5 GPF 's sppace 20 minutes ? What I . This situation annoying ... Are good diagnostic tools hardware ? Do think might software problem ( ie EMM386 etc. ) ? If helps , manage get GPF 's After Dark , quicken , Paint shop pro . A lot user.exe gdi.exe .
